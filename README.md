## Details
To make it easier to select and immerse yourself with the right tracks, they have all been categorised into Terran, Zerg, Protoss, and Extra, where Extra are music tracks that aren't specified for one race. Some tracks have specified factions too if you interested in sorting that way as well. Jukebox music has been specified as its own faction under the Terran race section.

Track names are built up like this:
(Race) (Number) - (Faction) (Song Name)
